# 2.S983 (Sports Technology) FC Barcelona Project

We worked with FC Barcelona's data science team to apply clustering methods to the attacks of their team. Through incorporating spatial, contextual, and statistical information into the clustering framework, we developed a holistic assessment of team attacking tendencies. We have created and refined a model which clusters opponent attacks into homogeneous subsets. This model is capable of assessing the degree of similarity across team attacking tendencies, providing information on which teams in La Liga have the most comparable attacks.
